# About
* This was made by Bradley McInenerney Fri, Sep 2019 for his loving girlfriend Sabrina
* This is ONLY AN ESTIMATION, the accuracy will depend on your own bias. For example if there is a keyword that usually make you happy but you only mention it in daylio when you are sad, the program will say it makes you sadder on average.
* Keep in mind you may only take notes of some things when you are feeling down even if they may not make you down all the time. Because of the accuracy of the notes may not be accurate enough to draw any conusive data from.

# How to use
* Your exported csv from your Daylio app must be in the same folder as main.py
* Change the settings to suit you (more info below)
* Run main.py
